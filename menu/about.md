title: About me
---


I grew up in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and now live in the beautiful city of Toronto - home of the 2018-2019 NBA champions. When I'm not working, you can find me watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/jamesdtran/), cooking, pet sitting, playing [volleyball](http://www.9-man.com/) and basketball, and biking around the city.

I believe that biology is fundamentally interesting, and that everyone benefits from having a better understanding of the biological processes happening all around us that keep us alive.

By training scientists to [communicate their ideas](https://biorender.com/) and making science [more accessible](https://www.scienceforlife.org/) to the general public, we can gain more support for science-based reasoning and policies to help solve some of the world's biggest problems: lifestyle-based diseases, communicable diseases, and global warming.
