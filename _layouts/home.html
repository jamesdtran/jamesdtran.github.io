I'm a recent PhD graduate from the <a href="https://medbio.utoronto.ca">Department of Medical Biophysics</a> at the University of Toronto. I studied cancer predisposition in Li-Fraumeni syndrome alongside a talented cross-disciplinary team at the <a href="https://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Directory/People/M/David-Malkin-staff-profile.html">Malkin lab</a> in the SickKids Research Institute.
<br>
<br>
As a trained cell biologist, I used CRISPR technology to understand how mutations in the <i>TP53</i> gene can initiate cancer development, and explored the effects of restoring normal p53 function in cell-based models.

<br>
Today, I analyze data for <a href="https://www.benchsci.com/">BenchSci</a>'s machine learning platform, and help clients in biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields as a contract science consultant for <a href="https://www.bloomburton.com/">Bloom Burton & Co</a>.
